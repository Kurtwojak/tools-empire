# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain the following font file:

- `Flama.otf` - The Flama font file used for the Panel Generator

Place your Flama font file in this directory as `Flama.otf` to enable proper text rendering in the Panel Generator.

Note: Due to licensing restrictions, the Flama Bold font file is not included in the repository. You will need to:
1. Purchase or obtain a licensed copy of the Flama Bold font
2. Convert it to WOFF2 format (if needed)
3. Place the file in this directory as `Flama-Bold.woff2`

Until the font is added, the Panel Generator will fall back to a system font.
